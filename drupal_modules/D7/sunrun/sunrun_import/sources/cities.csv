<p>Ever since Bill started keeping up with NASA's solar-powered satellites and space station, he kept his eye on photovoltaic technology. Now, Bill sees solar in action on roofs, parking garages, and streetlights all through his neighborhood. ""Living life, I've become aware of solar power,"" said Bill, ""Solar has been around for a long time.""</p>
<p>Life in the sunbelt made Bill to think even more about solar energy. Everywhere he looked, he found new solar panel companies sprouting up and new media articles about solar power in his city.</p>
<p>When Bill's neighbors across the street started investigating home solar options, he paid attention. They purchased their solar panels and shared their utility bill savings with Bill. Bill and Julie were impressed but were discouraged by the high upfront cost of purchasing a solar system. ""I didn't have $50,000 as an outlay, so I forgot about it,"" Bill explained.</p>
<p>Then Bill learned about Sunrun solar leasing. With a Sunrun solar lease, Bill and Julie were able to get started with solar power for $0. Sunrun purchased the system, and all they had to do was pay monthly for their solar electricity. Finally, after years of waiting, Bill brought the power of the sun from the depths of outer space to the comfort of his Arizona home.</p>","<a href=""http://www.arizonasolarenergy.org/"">AZ Solar Energy Association</a>

By upgrading their homes to solar, homeowners can save money on their bills, control electric rates, and support local jobs.",Bill's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Clean, alternative energy meant a lot to Bill. He had been interested in alternative energy since early childhood. Memories of visiting Holland and images of windmills lining the coast have figured in his mind for years. When he was stationed in Germany with the Luke Air Force, he would frequently vacation in Holland and would be reminded again of his childhood memories of clean energy, seeing the wind turbines line the beautiful coast.</p>
<p>His passion for clean energy was affirmed when he was sent to fight in Operation Desert Storm, he told us. Memories returned, but this time, haunting, as he recalls how dark the skies were during the war; he can still see the oil rigs burning in the distance. There was so much oil in the sky, Bill noted.</p>
<p>The Air Force then moved him to Arizona, a great state for solar, where he lives today in Goodyear. Bill retired from the Air Force in 2001, but the thoughts of solar only grew stronger as he realized how much sun Goodyear, Arizona received. For Bill, the stars were aligned for Goodyear, Arizona solar. Bill believed it “made sense to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and keep carbon underground where it’s supposed to be” and that solar technology was in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, years of service had instilled in Bill a commitment to duty. Although he had completed his military duty, he holds fast to what he believes are his civic duties. “Even though your civic duty is to go to the polls and vote, you have a daily duty to vote with your dollars,” Bill explained. Bill decided to go solar in Goodyear, Arizona with Sunrun and vote with his dollars…without putting any of those dollars upfront. Owning a Goodyear solar home with Sunrun proved a win-win: Bill feels better about where he’s getting his energy and no money was taken out of his pocket. And best of all, he feels prepared. Though he admits he does not have a crystal ball, he has a sneaking suspicion that his utility will keep raising the cost of power over time and when they do? He will be prepared.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">For Erik, going solar in Brea was all about using technology to do things smarter. He knew that owning a Brea solar home was a financially wise investment and that there was great urgency behind renewable energy, given the current energy crisis. Erik believed that the country had to achieve energy independence and free themselves from importing energy. He also knew that there were plentiful natural and renewable resources out there for energy generation. All that was necessary was the right technology, and he knew it was out there.</p>
 
<p>Installing a photovoltaic system was not all that Erik wanted to do, however, to save money and make a difference in the environment. He had grand plans for his home, but knew that all the home improvements could add up to be quite costly. Erik considered purchasing a system outright but the upfront cost was simply too much to add in conjunction to his other projects. ""Do I really want to spend all our savings on this at the time?"" he asked himself.</p>
 
<p>He went back to REC Solar, from whom he had gotten a solar quote, and told them of his predicament. They immediately recommended the Sunrun Solar Service payment option. Erik was able to get started with solar for several hundred dollars and have money left over to install a solar thermal system, purchase a greywater recycling treatment system, and do other things around the house that were beneficial for the environment and the long term investment in his house and home value.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">Dan knows a thing or two about power. As a former employee of a utility power plant for 25 years, he “knows what it takes to produce power, how dirty it is, and what the pollutants are to generate that kind of power.” It was this familiarity with dirty power that convinced Dan to turn to clean, home solar energy. “As far as power goes, I understand what solar is all about,” Dan stated.</p>
 
<p>In addition, Dan had been noticing that his utility rates kept rising. Despite his slight utility’s employee discount, the increase in rates was just too much for his household.</p>
 
<p>He soon began his search online for Brentwood photovoltaic installers and found PetersenDean, one of Sunrun’s solar installation partners. Dan was blown away when he learned about the Sunrun solar financing option. “You just can’t beat that,” said Dan. He was most impressed with the fact that even if one did have “money in the bank,” they did not have to deplete those funds to fund a home solar system.</p>
 
<p>Dan has already started saving money with his Sunrun power purchase agreement and is thinking of adding more panels to his Brentwood solar system. A fierce clean energy and Sunrun advocate, he’s currently working on getting his neighbors to invest in their own Brentwood solar panels.</p>

<p>With a solar power purchase agreement, they can pay for home solar electricity by the month with the reassurance that the rate they pay for home solar won't ever go up. Plus, Chris and Wanda won’t have to miss out on their retirement fun to deal with their home’s solar panels since Sunrun takes care of all of the maintenance. Now that’s hassle-free.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">As a Special Education teacher and coach, Bruce has always been conscientious about the future of his students. For a very long time, Bruce has been interested in alternative energy sources, and since wind is not very abundant in Clovis, solar was the smartest choice. It also wasn’t by chance that Bruce stumbled upon Sunrun, since he has been interested in solar for the last 15 years. Bruce didn’t know of anyone else who had gone solar, but after extensive research, he knew that Sunrun was the right choice for him. Not only did Sunrun offer the best package, which includes maintenance, panel repair, and full-solar insurance, but he was also impressed by Sunrun’s responsiveness and ability to provide clarity on any questions he had.</p>
 
<p>Since Bruce took the time to do solar research and inquiries, he wanted to make sure that the decision process was easier for his friends and family. He has already referred six people, one of whom has signed up for solar power service, and he wants to try to get his whole neighborhood to go solar with Sunrun. Bruce recognized that leasing a system was a financial win win situation since buying the system upfront was not an option. Adding to Bruce’s utility bill went from over $900 to $10 per month. In the words of Bruce, “Your savings are phenomenal with Sunrun!”</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">Long-time resident of Diamond Bar, California, Bruce Buller had been seeking ways to be more environmentally friendly for years. He started by making small changes around the home, and even invested in an electric car. Despite his actions, he noticed his electric bills remained high. During the winter, Bruce typically paid $179/month, and $235/month during the summer.</p>
 
<p>Bruce looked into getting a home solar system, but was dismayed to discover that the cost of a system was beyond the stretch of his income. After a year of searching for an affordable solution, he discovered Sunrun solar power service. With Sunrun, he was able to switch to solar power in February 2010 for $0 upfront for a medium-sized system. Since going solar, Bruce has experienced an approximate 15% in savings, and his winter bills have dropped to $152/month and summer bills to $200/month.</p>
 
<p>Now, Bruce and his family get around 70% of their power from the sun, and have even renamed the license place of their electric car – now powered by Sunrun - first to “SUN MPV”, or Sun Miles Per Volt, then to 1Sunrun. They’re also attempted to reduce their electric consumption even further, by adding additional insulation in their attic and switching from compact fluorescent (CFL) to LED lighting. After switching to solar, Bruce and his family have become more aware of their power usage, making sure to turn off lights and unplug appliances when not in use, as well as opt out of their dishwasher’s heated dry cycle.</p>

",Sanjay's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">When looking into home solar in Fremont home, Sanjay knew he didn't want to purchase a system outright. Instead, he wanted to find an affordable solution that allowed him do something good for the environment. Luckily, when he looked for installation companies, he found Sunrun. When he heard about Sunrun, Sanjay realized it fit exactly what he was looking for. With Sunrun, Sanjay pays for his solar electricity when he uses it with a power purchase agreement, just like he used to pay for electricity with PG&amp;E in Fremont. But, the power is clean, renewable, and comes straight from the panels on his roof. Because the rate he pays for electricity from Sunrun is fixed for the next 18 years,</p>
 
<p>Sanjay also won't have to suffer through PG&amp;E's expensive rate increases. Sanjay also appreciates that Sunrun will take care of any maintenance or repair issues that come up with his Fremont solar home. About a month after his panels were up and running, there was a minor problem with the system. But, says Sanjay, ""Sunrun noticed the problem before we did and took care of it. They called me and sent an email. I didn't need to do anything; they took care of it."" Through Sunrun home solar, Sanjay discovered the best way to cut energy and utility prices and still have professionals monitor the care of his system. It really is the best of both worlds.</p>

A growing number of roofs and plenty of sunshine make Lincoln, CA a great city for home solar power. That's why more and more residents are choosing to get solar panels for their homes. by installing solar systems, homeowners are putting the sun to work lowering their electric bills.",Tom's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Tom knew he had extremely high electric bills, and he knew his neighbors did, too. He had moved into his neighborhood around 2003, and so did most of his neighbors. All of the homes had been new and everyone had looked at each other's homes in the buying process.</p>
 
<p>Tom knew that going solar would help him control his ever-increasing electric bills, and so he started exploring his solar options. His annual electric bill had been $2,400 and it was projected to reach $3,200! He knew something had to be done.</p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, after some research, Tom realized that the high upfront cost of buying a photovolataic system was much more than he wanted to spend. However, during his search, he had spoken with a solar installation company that told him about Sunrun and its solar power service plans. Tom was immediately impressed. ""Sunrun works out really well for people economically,"" Tom explained, ""You don't have to spend $35,000 on a system. With Sunrun, solar costs you less right now and at the end of your service agreement, you can buy the system out, and you'll spend less money.""</p>
 
<p>During his installation, Tom's neighbor, Jim, came over, curious about what was happening at Tom's house. Tom explained that he was going solar with Sunrun. Within 24 hours, Jim had signed up for Sunrun. The next day, another neighbor - Richard - walked over to Tom's house. Tom explained that renewable energy would help lock in rising electricity rates and add value to his home, and Richard was hooked. He also signed up for Sunrun.</p>
 
<p>Soon after that, Tom became known around town as the solar guru. Neighbors came to him to talk about their high power bills. Others asked if Tom knew of any ways to make solar affordable. One neighbor asked for a personal energy audit, another wanted to go solar for environmental reasons, and the other wanted advice on shaving their utility usage off the highest tiers. Tom helped all of them, and all of them switched to Sunrun's solar power service.</p>
 
<p>The solar word spread like wildfire and before he knew it, all six of his neighbors had switched to Sunrun. Now, when they get together for neighborhood gatherings, poker nights, and block parties, they discuss their PV production. Tom monitors the entire neighborhood's solar power generation and keeps track of each home's data. With Sunrun and Tom, their own personal solar patroller, the neighborhood can rest easy knowing that we're watching their systems.</p>

",Nonda's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Nonda had had it with her utility company. Her utility bills were escalating and she knew it was time to start taking control of her electricity costs. “Our bills were so high, at one point it was $850,” she recalled, “it’s outrageous.”</p>
 
<p>But, Nonda and her family were not electricity “hogs”, she explained. They had always had high utility bills – they owned a pool – but after living away from home and returning after three to four years, they noticed a huge leap in their utility rates. “We recently came back and it was just outrageous,” Nonda exclaimed, “outrageous for nothing!” It was this unexpected and unexplainable rise in prices that drove Nonda to investigate Livermore’s solar options.</p>
 
<p>She knew it was time to look into home solar. Luckily, she had just received a postcard in the mail from Acro Energy, one of Sunrun’s Livermore photovoltaic installation partners. She was immediately drawn to Sunrun’s affordable solar financing options - particularly the solar power purchase agreement. “It’s reasonable without having to fork out $30,000 to buy [a home solar system],” said Nonda, “It’s a good program.”</p>
 
<p>Now, at their home in Livermore, solar has allowed them cut their high energy costs and take control of their electricity rates. Sunrun has helped Nonda and thousands of homeowners across the country get access to affordable, clean home solar energy. “It’s a good thing Sunrun is doing.”</p>

",Jim & Carol's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">When Jim and his wife Carol started looking into Napa home solar, it was all about 'going green.' They soon realized they were even more excited about the investment - and returns - they could make in having a photovoltaic system. Thinking about how much money he'd save over the next 25 or 30 years with home solar electricity, Jim realized that it was like he was earning 20% per year on a financial investment. ""But, try to get a 20% return in the stock market year after year!"" he says.</p>
 
<p>Jim also loves that with a Sunrun power purchase agreement he's locking in his power bill for the next 18 years. For his home, solar power with Sunrun cost only one third of the highest price he was paying PG&amp;E. Because the Sunrun rate never goes up, he's sure his savings will only get better over time. ""Even in 2025, I will still be paying 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and who knows how much the PG&amp;E rates will be by then.""</p>
 
<p>Jim also loves that Sunrun ""includes a sexy monitoring device that calculates exactly how much energy is being generated."" If Sunrun fails to live up to their agreement to deliver him the promised power, it will refund him because his system's performance is guaranteed. Knowing that Sunrun has total responsibility for all of his home solar system is also a plus. That way Jim can spend time with Carol and Linus, the wonder dog, without worrying that his PV panels might not be working properly. It also leaves him time to collaborate with a ""somewhat maverick winemaking team"" at Manifesto!, where he is a principal.</p>

",Susanne's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Back in the late ‘70s, Susanne’s family decided to get solar panels to heat their pool. Although, there was not enough sunlight to create enough energy through the panels, they were still happy to be generating renewable energy. When Susanne and her family moved to their home in Novato, solar power was a high priority. Susanne’s family went through meetings with three other photovoltaic companies for Novato PV options. But she learned that these installation companies couldn’t give her the amount of panels she needed for a reasonable price.</p>
 
<p>But then a friend at Real Goods introduced Susanne to Sunrun's affordable solar power service via a solar lease. After many years of looking into solar energy in Novato, Susanne has finally gotten the system and power generation she has always wanted through Sunrun.</p>

",Paul & Yumi's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">A chemistry professor at University of California at Berkeley, Paul was looking into several solar power options when he learned about Sunrun. He realized right away that Sunrun was the best way to get a photovoltaic system. For Paul and Yumi's energy needs, Sunrun Solar Service was the perfect solution. They could enjoy all the benefits of solar energy without any ongoing bills. Instead, they paid for their electricity upfront, at the start of their agreement. They didn't have to wait around for the federal and state solar rebates either because Sunrun did the waiting for them and gave them the full value of the incentives immediately.</p>
 
<p>In addition, this Oakland, CA couple is excited about getting more for their money with Sunrun's comprehensive suite of services that they wouldn't get if they purchased a system themselves. That Sunrun takes complete care of their system, including solar monitoring, inverter replacement, system insurance, and panel washing, means zero headaches and hassles for Paul and Yumi.</p>
 
<p>Paul and Yumi see clean energy as a great investment - financially and environmentally. They'll enjoy significant savings on power for years to come and they've reduced their dependence on fossil fuels big time. With the addition of sleek, cutting-edge photovoltaic panels to their home, they've already received compliments and inquiries from neighbors.</p>

Sheltered in Coachella Valley, Palm Springs' sunny and dry weather make the city perfect for producing solar energy. By going solar, Palm Springs homeowners can take advantage of the bountiful sunshine and start saving on their electric bills. ",Revone's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">I was very excited to move to Palm Springs from the Midwest in 2009. It had proven costly and quite difficult to build an energy efficient home in an area that didn’t necessarily “get” sustainability, and I looked forward to finding a green home in sunny California.</p>
 
<p>What I wanted most of all was to have a solar powered home – a home with panels that converted all of our California sunshine into pollution-free electricity. Alas, I quickly discovered that there were no homes with photovoltaic (PV) panels in my price range. Luckily, I found a well-insulated desert home, complete with a solar-heated pool and plenty of south-facing roof, just begging for PV panels.</p>
 
<p>I wanted to purchase a home solar system, but I dreaded the thought of saving up or financing another $20,000 or $30,000. I also wondered if I was getting too old to scale a roof and juggle wires again. I had exhausted myself and my wallet the first (and last) time I installed solar panels myself. Unable to find a reliable installer in the Midwest, I signed up for and completed a Real Goods solar installer class, ordered all the materials, and guided my electrician and a high school assistant through a first-timers 3 kWh PV installation.</p>
 
<p>I attended a couple of solar information meetings put on by solar installers local to my neighborhood. I was amazed to learn that in California, you could actually lease solar power. However, I was disappointed that many of these local installers refused to offer such a lease.</p>
 
<p>I contacted Real Goods again and found out that they had just teamed up with SunRun, a home solar power service company. I was excited! Not only would Real Goods take care of the whole installation, but SunRun offered great service plans, which included leasing, for homeowners. Outright ownership was one option, but I remembered all the extra paperwork and maintenance commitment from my Midwest home. I also considered the voice I would have as a single solar homeowner. When I previously tried to spread the word about solar PV, I had found that a lone PV system owner didn’t have much clout, or receive much welcome, at coal burning electric monopoly meetings. (I must admit, though, that getting kicked out of coal-based utility meetings was subversive fun).</p>
 
<p>SunRun was where my solar dreams came true. I could pay no money down and lease a 5.5 kWh solar PV system for a low monthly electric bill that came to about 19 cents/kWh with SunRun Power Plan. Or I could pay for 18 years of electricity upfront with SunRun Total Solar, for 10 cents/kWh. How could I go wrong?</p>
 
<p>Electricity rates in Palm Springs are on a tiered-rate that starts at 13 cents/kWh, which only covers about my first 5 days of electricity. Then, the rate skyrockets up to 32 cents/kWh for any usage over about 700 kWh. Here in the desert, air conditioning and pool pumps can drive electricity bills upwards of $300 to $800! With SunRun, I could ensure that my family’s electricity was green, cheap, guaranteed, and most importantly, brought choice and control away from the utilities and into our hands. I look forward to the day when SunRun owns enough megawatts of small, rooftop, solar electric arrays to have the political influence it takes to make this state, our country, and our world a sustainable place to live.</p>
 
<p>As a long time “greenie,” I realize that being green by yourself is good, but being green as an economic force is great. I’ve empowered a green company like SunRun by allowing them to own my solar panels, and my small contribution will combine with other PV users, and soon, sustainable energy providers will be the dominant force in energy politics.</p>
 
<p>Join the thousands of sustainable rooftop owners like me who are holding themselves accountable for their families’ electricity usage and enabling companies like SunRun to compete with the big and dirty electric utilities.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">As a retired captain in the US Army, Philip is used to paying close attention to details. When he started investigating solar power, Philip focused on the cost of photovoltaic panels and compared many San Diego photovoltaic panel manufacturers. But then Philip realized what he really needed was home solar electricity - not a certain type of panel.</p>
 
<p>With this in mind, Philip discovered that Sunrun's solar power service was the best option for him. To Phil, it made more sense to go with a power purchase agreement. With Sunrun, he only had to pay for the power. Phil and Masako didn't have to pay for any equipment or worry about solar panel maintenance.</p>
 
<p>With Sunrun, Phil and Masako saved over 50% on the upfront cost and were able to remodel their kitchen at the same time.</p>
 
<p>They're also excited about the low fixed rate Sunrun offers for their electricity. They started to save money right away on power and, by switching to home solar power in San Diego, their electricity rate will stay low and fixed for 18 years while utility rates will keep climbing.</p>
 
<p>For Phil, Sunrun's complimentary maintenance and repair, and monitoring were an added bonus. Not to mention that Sunrun guarantees Phil will get all the electricity promised in the agreement or his money back. ""At 65, you don't want to climb on your roof,"" he said.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">Ever since Rochelle heard about solar, she knew she wanted it for her house. Solar energy was clean and sustainable, and Rochelle knew that she wanted to make a difference in the environment, no matter the cost. She called San Francisco photovoltaic companies to receive estimates on her house, but the story they told her was always the same. Rochelle was living alone at the time and her electricity bill was very low – around $25 per month. They told her that getting home solar in SF simply wasn’t worth the cost and quoted her the same high upfront figures over and over. With her low electricity bill, Rochelle didn’t think a solar power system was going to work out for her financially.</p>
 
<p>Then, Rochelle heard of San Francisco’s GoSolarSF program, which provides substantial solar rebates for non-profit organizations and low-income residents. Excited about the Mayor’s initiative, Rochelle called up more installation companies but the upfront cost was still too high. She knew she wasn’t spending enough on electricity to make the high upfront cost worth it, financially, but Rochelle was determined to keep trying.</p>
 
<p>One day, Rochelle was listening to the radio when she heard a speaker mention Sunrun. She immediately called Sunrun and explained her situation. Sunrun understood that Rochelle’s determination to get clean energy was driven by environmental stewardship, rather than cost savings, and Rochelle, Sunrun, and the city of San Francisco were soon able to work something out. With Sunrun, she was able to finally go solar in San Francisco with Sunrun Solar Service and the best part? “It hardly cost anything.”</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">Dennis and his wife discovered the San Luis Obispo area when one of their sons attended Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. A long time wine connoisseur, Dennis built his new home in the Edna Ranch area, surrounded by vineyards. They spent over 3 years designing and constructing their home, and love living in the country. Not quite as enjoyable were the high rural power rates that came with country living, which cost them up to $500 every month.</p>
 
<p>Dennis initially wondered whether he should wait to get a system, but he realized that he shouldn't wait for future technology advances in solar power because there was no time like the present. Luckily, solar power was readily available in San Luis Obispo through Sunrun. Dennis says “I felt that Sunrun was the right thing to do - both environmentally and for the long haul. It was time to step up."" Dennis didn't initially consider home solar leases, but he liked that Sunrun fixes anything that goes wrong with his system. He also chose Sunrun because it was the solution that would most easily allow him to sell his San Luis Obispo solar home in the future.</p>
 
<p>Since going solar in San Luis Obispo with a Sunrun power purchase agreement, Dennis and his wife now pay well under half every month that they previously paid for power.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">For Eric and his wife, the sun was the problem and the solution. Their home in Santa Clara, California was old, in direct sunlight, and ultimately very hot – “worse than hot,” according to Eric. They were reluctant to purchase an air conditioner – worried that running the AC would raise their electricity bills too much. “It seemed wrong to buy an AC and pay to run it in the hottest part of the day,” Eric explained.</p>
 
<p>But the sun that made their home a sauna could also power their home, Eric figured. So, Eric and his wife started looking into home solar options. Not only did Eric see his Santa Clara solar panels as powering and offsetting the air conditioner, but as a full-time bike commuter, Eric felt they would be “another good, environmentally conscious thing to do.”</p>
 
<p>He struck up a conversation with 1BOG, a community solar purchasing program that had partnered with Sunrun, and through them heard about the Sunrun solar power service. He also spoke with GroSolar, Sunrun’s Santa Clara PV installation company. While he had always wanted to go solar, the high upfront cost had kept his dream at bay. But with Sunrun, there was no cash necessary upfront. For Eric and others like him in sunny Santa Clara, solar was finally the solution.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">Linda and Suzi had been trying to get a solar system for several years. Running a successful internet business out of their home left them with monthly electricity bills between $600 and $900.</p>
 
<p>Achieving energy independence and saving money were two objectives that they hoped a Solvang solar home could meet. But, for their two homes, solar power became quite expensive. Because they needed a system of a certain size to power both homes on their property, the initial cost of purchasing a large photovoltaic system was preventing them from moving forward with solar.</p>
 
<p>Once they heard about the lower upfront cost available from a Sunrun power purchase agreement, Linda and Suzi jumped at the opportunity for affordable clean energy. They were particularly happy with the smooth design and installation offered by Sunrun's expert and local Solvang solar installer partners. And, since they've started with Sunrun, their Solvang solar home has seen a whopping 70% decrease in its monthly electricity bills.</p>
 
<p>One thing Linda likes best about Sunrun is that she doesn’t have any liability for her home solar power system. Her system doesn't change her insurance premium and it is fully insured by Sunrun.</p>

The city enjoys sunny summers and mild winters – it's no wonder solar rooftops are becoming increasingly common throughout the city. By installing solar panels, homeowners are taking control of their electricity and rising utility rates. Solar homeowners in Stockton lock in low rates for power and save thousands in power bills over time.
",Gaye's Story,"<p id=""cleantext"">Quite a crew lives in Gaye's farmhouse in Stockton -- her daughter and son-in-law, her grandchildren, and a pack of alpacas. And before the alpacas, were the racehorses. With so many people living in this family compound, Gaye knew that she needed to do something about her high electricity bills. She was tired of paying PG&amp;E bills from $400 to $800/month. Even though the family tried to be careful with their energy usage, it wasn't always so easy. Her grandchildren would watch television and occasionally forget to turn the lights off. Nothing crazy, but the cost of PG&amp;E was going through the roof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gaye knew she wanted solar for her farm. She knew it was the smart thing to do and wanted to make a difference in the environment, as well. But, she simply did not have the time to do the research for Stockton solar power, since she was working full-time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But her daughter and son-in-law did not let Gaye give up on her dream of solar in Stockton, California. They got to work and her daughter started researching photovoltaic options. Two years of searching for affordable solar power proved fruitless as the only option at the time was purchasing a system outright, which was simply too much upfront cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luckily, Gaye's daughter ran across REC Solar and Sunrun and learned about the possibility of a power purchase agreement. A PPA was exactly what Gaye was looking for and the family quickly signed up for Sunrun Solar Service. Gaye started saving immediately and now, her utility bill is often under $25, all thanks to Sunrun and her solar farm in Stockton.</p>

",Mohsen's Story,"<p>Just by listening to the news, Mohsen easily saw that electricity prices were going up and were going to keep going up. Not to mention what he could see with his own eyes when his power bill came in the mail every month.</p>
<p>Delving further into his monthly electricity bills and how much he was paying Southern California Edison was the last straw, and Mohsen started to look into home solar power.</p>
<p>In sunny Thousand Oaks, solar was an obvious alternative form of energy and for Mohsen, Sunrun Solar Service seemed like the straightforward, easy way get it for his home. He could pay for his photovoltaic panels by the month while Sunrun would take care of the system on his roof. Mohsen loved how easy the process was, too. He wrote a check and a few days later he had 40 panels up on his roof and a clean, green solar home to his name.</p>
<p>As soon as his system was up and running, Mohsen saw his electricity bills from SCE plummet; it went from $430 to $4.60! And, he knows his savings will only increase over time as SCE's electricity gets more expensive while his price for California solar electricity from Sunrun remains fixed.</p>
<p>For Mohsen, the best part about Sunrun is the professional-grade home monitoring that comes with Sunrun Solar Service. That way he can log-in on the Sunrun website to see how much power his system is producing. Plus, he like the reassurance that Sunrun can see exactly how his system is doing and knows right away if anything goes wrong.</p>

",Dianne & John's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Dianne and John moved up to Tulare County from Southern California in 2002 and enjoy the slower pace of life that came with living in the country. During a home remodel in 2003 when they were updating their house to make it more energy efficient to cope with Tulare's hot summers and cold winters, they wanted to get home solar panels. But they found it was simply too expensive and complicated to justify.</p>
 
<p>That's why they were so excited when they heard about Sunrun's smart new approach that allowed them to finance home solar energy. Since they have some substantial electrical demands at their home including a well water pump, owning a Tulare County solar home made sense for reducing their energy costs.</p>
 
<p>In addition to the cost savings that came with Sunrun home solar service, Dianne was very pleased with their installation, and said ""These are good people to have around. Very professional. Very fast. No glitches. Everyone we have dealt with has been so professional and easy to work with.""</p>
 
<p>In addition, Dianne likes that Sunrun will be taking care of her panels over the long term. This means her Springville solar home will keep saving on energy every month and she’ll never have to worry about her panels. In their neighborhood in Springville, solar is becoming a hot topic of discussion. Diane and John have already told a number of their friends in Tulare about Sunrun so they can save money with affordable California solar systems too..</p>

It's beautiful, but this also means lots of leaves, debris, and falling branches - especially in the winter storm season. Fortunately, with Sunrun home solar, they don't have to worry about any damage that might be done to their system. Sunrun means Francoise and Aharon enjoy free maintenance and repairs, monitoring, panel washing, and system insurance.</p>
 
<p>Francoise and Aharon have reduced their dependence on fossil fuels, which they count as a huge benefit of their PV panels. They've already offset tons of CO2 emissions, and they're pleased their commitment to solar in Woodside, CA and the health of the environment will make a meaningful impact in the years to come.</p>

<p id=""cleantext"">Even before Van moved into his current house in Louisville, solar was on his mind. Van had always been interested in getting home solar panels in Louisville, but it was simply too expensive to do so. When Boulder County began offering its Climate Smart Program, a program that provides upfront financing for home solar projects, Van and his family immediately called their local Louisville solar company, REC Solar. The excitement was short-lived, however, as they soon discovered that the home solar loan program was less than ideal for their situation. According to Van, when it came down to the dollar amount, the upfront home solar loan was more expensive than a typical home loan.</p>
 
<p>Luckily, Van and the REC representative kept in touch and when Sunrun launched in Colorado, Van was one of the first to hear about a new way in which he could finance his home solar in Louisville - solar leasing. While there are a number of different home solar financing options, many include hidden complications. With Sunrun, getting home solar panels is straightforward and simple.</p>
 
<p>Van and his family were able to have a Louisville solar home even earlier than expected, as his installation process was able to be pushed forward, and they couldn't be more excited.

",Adam's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Adam initially began his search for home solar in Ashland, MA in early 2009. During this search, Adam discussed the advantages and benefits of solar frequently with his 11-year-old son. The search continued and so did the animated conversations with his sun. Unfortunately, after considering several companies, Adam realized that the upfront cost was simply too high for their family to go solar in Ashland at the time. But his son didn't give up hope. Even at such a young age, Adam's son was passionate about the environmental benefits of owning an Ashland solar home. He felt it saved energy and saved the earth.</p>
 
<p>So, the family waited and the 11-year-old continued to hope. Then, one day that summer, Adam read an article about Sunrun in the Boston Globe and learned of its power purchase agreement program. He contacted two Massachusetts solar companies and learned that both were working with the Sunrun program. By then, it was a no-brainer. With Sunrun, Adam and his family were able to go solar for $0! Everyone, especially his son, was ecstatic. Adam's two young sons had a great time watching the panels getting installed on their roof.</p>
 
<p>Adam and his family love their Sunrun home PV panels. While they have already started saving money, they care more about what owning a clean power generation system means for the environment and the renewable energy movement. In fact, they were so happy with their panels that they urged their parents in New Jersey to go solar, as well. Thanks to the passion of an 11-year old, two generations of a family upgraded their homes to clean and affordable energy and joined the fight against climate change.</p>

",Doug's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Doug and his wife had been greening their home extensively over the past five years – replacing windows, insulating the house, switching from oil to high efficiency gas, installing more energy efficient appliances. Installing photovoltaic panels on their rooftop was the culmination of all these smaller green steps, the final upgrade to their home. They had lived in their home for 17 years and both of their children were out of the house – one having just graduated college, another currently attending college. It was about time, they decided, that they did something “more efficient, more environmentally sound, more conscious-driven.” What better way to do that than switching their home to renewable power?</p>
 
<p>But, they didn’t want to worry about the panels. That’s why Doug’s family chose clean and affordable energy with Sunrun. They liked the idea that Sunrun would take care of everything, from permitting and state rebates all the way to system maintenance and repair.

<p id=""cleantext"">A retired teacher, Susan spent most of her adult life in her current home in Whitman, Massachusetts. Over the years, Susan kept an eye on her utility bills and watched her National Grid utility bills climb steadily, much to her dismay. Her electric bills would only continue to increase, she realized, but her savings would not – retired, Susan was on a fixed income. She knew she had to “level the playing field” somehow.</p>
<p>Susan had a hunch that going solar in Whitman, MA would do just that. With a perfect south facing roof, the odds were good. She started her search on the Internet and signed up for a free solar consultation. She had nothing to lose, she figured, since it was a free assessment. She asked her brother, who used to work for National Grid, to look over the paperwork. He told her that switching to clean energy in with Sunrun was a “no-brainer.” “You can get a fixed rate for your electricity and get almost half – 46% - of your electricity from your panels,” he told her.</p>
<p>Susan immediately signed up for a power purchase agreement with Sunrun. What she likes best is that Sunrun takes care of all the services for her residential renewable energy system. She’s excited that Sunrun is monitoring her system closely and provides a money-back performance guarantee.</p>
 
<p>And as for that playing field? Susan was comparing her electricity bills before and after solar, for the same month, and noticed that she is already pulling 10kW less electricity from the utility. (And that’s including the addition of a new air conditioner, post going panels).<br /> </p>
<p>Susan’s been so pleased with her panels that she’s already gotten a neighbor on board! Her home was the first solar home in her community, but thanks to her satisfaction with Sunrun, it’s no longer the only one.</p>

",Carolyn's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Carolyn had always been interested in solar for environmental reasons. Her previous home had been great for passive solar, and she’d put in a sun room and radiating floors. A few years ago, in her current home, Carolyn installed a solar hot water heater. She was interested in solar electricity (photovoltaics) but thought it was out of her price range. “Passive solar was the only thing really available at the time,” Carolyn explained, “Active solar was way too expensive.”</p>
 
<p>But she didn’t give up and continued to look into solar electricity for her home. After a few years, the local company that installed her solar hot water told her about their new partnership with Sunrun. They explained that with Sunrun, Carolyn could pay for solar electricity, instead of an expensive system. Carolyn waited until Sunrun was available in Havre de Grace, then signed up right away and became Sunrun’s first customer in Maryland.</p>

",Francis' Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">When Francis thinks about energy, the first thing that comes to mind is security. One of Francis’ main concerns is shifting the U.S. away from dependence on oil. According to Francis, “if it weren’t for oil, we wouldn’t have to send troops into the desert to fight; we wouldn’t be fighting.”</p>
 
<p>This concept of energy independence and its impact on foreign affairs resides close to Francis heart as a retiree from the military. He and his wife are also currently awaiting the return of their son from the Navy – “it’s just me and my wife at home right now.” Concerned with the nation’s unhealthy reliance on foreign oil, as well as the impact on the environment, Francis knew it was time to look into solar power in Burlington, NJ.</p>
 
<p>Francis soon began his investigation into photovoltaic panels on the Internet and heard about Sunrun as a top home solar company based in California. He was pleased to discover that a local installation company had partnered with Sunrun to provide affordable solutions for his rooftop PV system.</p>
 
<p>Along with national and environmental security, Francis wanted to make sure that his finances were safe as well. He realized that by upgrading to smart and clean power, he would not only save money down the road on his electricity bills, but on the upfront cost, as well. Plus, he didn’t want to wait up to a year for his federal credits to kick in. With Sunrun, Francis received the full value of his federal tax credits right from the start, in the form of a lower upfront cost.</p>
 
<p>Another advantage was that Francis didn’t have to be responsible for maintaining his PV panels. “If something goes wrong, you have to come fix it. Sunrun’s monitoring the system for me – I don’t have to worry for the next 18 years!” And for Francis, that’s invaluable – national security and global warming are enough to worry about!</p>

<p>He contacted his local solar installer, Trinity Solar, who told him about Sunrun solar power service. With Sunrun, Eric didn't have to purchase the panels himself. Sunrun bought, owns, and maintains the system and Eric pays for solar electricity from Sunrun.

<p id=""cleantext"">As long-time educators and environmental advocates, Deborah and Kenneth had always dreamed of owning a solar home.

Kenneth and Debbie realized that going solar in Howell, NJ could help secure a better, healthier future for their sons and future grandchildren.</p>
 
<p>The road to a solar home, however, was not always an easy one. Despite the substantial rebate incentives in New Jersey, other obstacles got in the way of their green dream.

He was typically quoted a little less than $50,000 for a complete solar system. After his New Jersey solar rebate, the system still required a payment from Ed for over $25,000. He looked into solar financing options with his utility company, JCP&amp;L, which offered solar loans, but it wasn't a feasible option for Ed.</p>
<p> Everything changed in 2009, when Ed saw an article about Sunrun, a solar company based in California who was now offering solar power purchase agreements in New Jersey.</p>
<p> When Ed learned that Sunrun would pay for and install the panels, take care of them, and replace inverters as needed, Ed was thrilled. After all the trouble trying to figure out how to pay for his much-wanted solar system, all Ed had to now pay was $600 to get started.</p>
<p> The installation took three days. Watching his electric meter spin backwards after many years of spinning in the other direction brought tears to Ed's eyes. His solar dream had finally come true.</p>

",Shelly's Story,"<div class=""contact_form"">
<p id=""cleantext"">Shelly and her husband had been interested in solar power, but didn't know a whole lot about the process. They had lived in their house for 22 years and had been considering going solar in Salem County, NJ for five years. But, a home solar system was expensive. Because purchasing a system had never made much sense for them financially, they never researched solar or solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) thoroughly.</p>
 
<p>Then, Shelly's coworker decided to go solar and started talking about what she was finding with Shelly. Shelly decided to talk to a few local solar companies. One company told Shelly and her husband about Sunrun - a way for their family to purchase solar power instead of the system and avoid the high costs and maintenance hassles of owning a system.</p>
 
<p>Shelly and her husband have already begun to save money. ""We're happy so far,"" Shelly said, ""We've had our system up and running since January. Once the sun comes out and decides to stay out a little longer, we'll be even happier.""</p>

A year later, after seeing their friends' new solar system, they decided to reinvestigate.</p>
