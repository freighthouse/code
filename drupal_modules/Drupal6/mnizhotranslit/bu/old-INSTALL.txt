  Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Module:
    - Copy mnizhotranslit folder to your drupal modules folder:
        - [drupal root]/sites/all/modules
        - Also ensure that the newly copied folder has the correct ownership
          and permissions. (Compare to other modules if necessary.)
    - Verify File System is setup correctly
        - Go to Site Configuration->File system
        - If either File system path or Temporary directory is not working,
          please adjust folders or permissions as necessary.
    - Enable the MNI Chinese Transliteration module
        - Module list is usually under Site Building->Modules->List
        - Under Other enable the module
    - This will provide the adminstrator with two new Triggers to implement
        - Generate Traditional Chinese
        - Push Acquire XML
    - See below for proper setup of both, according to orginal specifications.

Triggers:
    - Enable Triggers module (May already be setup.)
        - Go to Site Building->Modules->List
        - Scroll to the Core-Optional section and enable the Trigger module.
    - Each of the following triggers can be activated whenever you like, based
      on any changing business logic.
    - Generate Traditional Chinese
        - This trigger will generate the Traditional Chinese content within
          the Drupal site.
    - Push Acquire XML
        - This trigger will create the xml files which will be pushed to
          Acquire Media's systems
    - Archive Translated Content
        - This trigger will create archived copies of any translated content.

Acquire Push Program
    - To push files to acquire we will need a new user created.
    - This user must have read, write, and exec access to the following dirs:
        - [drupal root]/sites/default/files/acquire_zho_xml/
        - [drupal root]/sites/all/modules/mnizhotranslit/
        - /tmp/mni6/tmp/acquire_archive/ (or other designated archive dir)
    - Please also ensure they execute acces to pushaqfiles.py, start_push.sh,
      and stop_push.sh
    - Adjust the directories in the pushConfig.cfg file in
      [drupal root]/sites/all/modules/mnizhotranslit/, to match the ones used
      above.
    - Change to the user that will be used to push files to Acquire
    - SSH into the Acquire system. Answer yes to connecting to a new host, if
      prompted.
    - logout
    - ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024
        - Use default for filename (id_dsa.pub)
        - Use a secure passphrase
    - scp .ssh/id_dsa.pub acquire.host:.ssh/
    - You may be prompted at this point for your secure passphrase. This will
      happen before being asked for your password to the Acquire system. If not
      you will be prompted later in the instructions.
    - SSH into the Acquire system.
    - cd .ssh
    - cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2
    - logout
    - SSH into the Acquire system.
        - If prompted for your secure passphrase, use it, and setup is complete.
        - If not prompted for any password or passphrase, setup is complete.
        - If prompted for your user password, setup was unsuccessful.
    - To start pushing, switch to the user created above, and run the following
      command:
        - [drupal root]/sites/all/modules/mnizhotranslit/pushaqfiles.py [drupal root]/sites/all/modules/mnizhotranslit/pushConfig.cfg
